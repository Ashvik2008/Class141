Create an App to provide users with recommendations on what to watch next based on what they have already watched.

Our app wil have 2 screens:
=> Screen 1(display movie one by one in a flatlist): take user input on the type of movie user likes
=> Screen 2: provide recommendation to user.

Features on the 1st page
1. User can mark the movie as liked, not liked,  not watched.
2. we will build 4 apis. one is for all movies(get request) to get all the movies. next 3 apis are for post request(liked, not-liked,not-watched)

all the movie information will be stored in 4 different list.

If the user likes a specific movie, that movie will be removed from the main list and will be added to the lied/not-liked/not-watched list to avoid repeatation.
